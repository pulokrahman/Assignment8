1. Describe the problem generics address.
Generics allows the program to define an arbitary data type for fields, properties, input, and return types of our class so we don't have to repeat multiple implementations of that class for each data type.   
2. How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?
List<String> l=new List<String>();
3. How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?
Two
4. True/False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match.
False
5. What method is used to add items to a List object?
Add
6. Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.
RemoveAt
Remove
7. How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?
Class {Name}<T> (where T:{Classes or Interface} //optional) 
8. True/False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter.
False
9. True/False. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.
True
10. True/False. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to.
True
